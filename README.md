# Blockland-Unlimited-Mining-Classic
 A rework of the classic Unlimited Mining game-mode for Blockland. Includes fixes for many known bugs and issues in the original. The goal of this project is simply to fix up the game-mode while maintaining the classic gameplay.

# Contributing
If you'd like to help fix up Unlimited Mining, contributions via [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) are welcome. Check the issues tab to see some of the things that need to be worked on. Just keep in mind a few guidelines:
- Code should be clean and manageable.
- Please stick to fixes and minor tweaks that maintain the classic experience. If you'd like to add major new features, consider forking the repository and making your own variant.

Here are some highlights of what we're looking to work on:
- [ ] Restoring the ruins! We either need to find an existing copy, or rewrite it from scratch. If you have any info, please reach out! Anything helps; screenshots or videos of the ruins can assist in recreating them. [\[View the issue\]](https://github.com/LakeYS/Blockland-Unlimited-Mining-Classic/issues/1)
- [ ] Making the game-mode cross-compatible with Blockland v20 and v21, for the added nostalgia value. [\[View the Issue\]](https://github.com/LakeYS/Blockland-Unlimited-Mining-Classic/issues/6)
- [ ] The ability to save an existing mine and re-load it later. [\[View the issue\]](https://github.com/LakeYS/Blockland-Unlimited-Mining-Classic/issues/22)

...And any other optimizations/fixes that improve the game-mode!
