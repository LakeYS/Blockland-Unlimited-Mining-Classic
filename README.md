# Blockland-Unlimited-Mining-Classic
 A rework of the classic Unlimited Mining game-mode for Blockland. Unlimited Mining Classic brings numerous bugfixes and quality of life improvements to the original Unlimited Mining. The goal of this project is to fix up the game-mode while maintaining the classic gameplay.

# Contributing
If you'd like to help improve Unlimited Mining, contributions via [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) are welcome. Check the issues tab to see some of the things that need to be worked on. The only guidelines are:
- Code should be clean and manageable.
- Fixes, optimizations, and inconsequential quality-of-life changes *only*--nothing that deviates from the original look, feel, and gameplay of Unlimited Mining.

If you would like to make major changes, feel free to create your own fork of the game-mode!

Here are some highlights of what we're looking to work on:
- [ ] Restoring the ruins! We either need to find an existing copy, or rewrite it from scratch. If you have any info, please reach out! [\[View the issue\]](https://github.com/LakeYS/Blockland-Unlimited-Mining-Classic/issues/1)
- [ ] Making the game-mode cross-compatible with Blockland v20 and v21, for the added nostalgia value. [\[View the Issue\]](https://github.com/LakeYS/Blockland-Unlimited-Mining-Classic/issues/6)
- [ ] The ability to save an existing mine and re-load it later. [\[View the issue\]](https://github.com/LakeYS/Blockland-Unlimited-Mining-Classic/issues/22)
