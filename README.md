# Blockland-Unlimited-Mining-Classic
This is a revamp of Unlimited Mining that preserves the "classic" (e.g. Red_Guy's server) gameplay of Unlimited Mining.

This is derived from version 12.0 of Unlimited Mining [found here](https://bl.kenko.dev/Add-ons/Retail/GameMode/GameMode_UnlimitedMining.zip).

# What's different in this version?
* The host and admins no-longer have cheats/special privileges (e.g. unlimited drills) at all times. Instead, this can be toggled with the "Admin cheats" pref.
* Small quality-of-life tweaks to gameplay.
    * The health of dirt has been adjusted so that mining is much quicker when first starting out.
* A number of other tweaks, bugfixes, and code cleanup.
    * Dormant bombs no-longer take money from you.
    * Various fixes for loading/unloading via the game-modes menu.
    * And more. A more comprehensive list of changes can be found in `changelog_Mining_Classic.txt`.

# Contributing
If you'd like to help improve Unlimited Mining, contributions via [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) are welcome. Check the issues tab to see some of the things that need to be worked on. The only guidelines are:
- Code should be clean and manageable.
- Fixes, optimizations, and inconsequential quality-of-life changes *only*--nothing that deviates from the original look, feel, and gameplay of Unlimited Mining.

If you would like to make major changes, feel free to create your own fork of the game-mode!

Here are some highlights of what we're looking to work on:
- [ ] Restoring the ruins! We either need to find an existing copy, or rewrite it from scratch. If you have any info, please reach out! [\[View the issue\]](https://github.com/LakeYS/Blockland-Unlimited-Mining-Classic/issues/1)
- [ ] Making the game-mode cross-compatible with Blockland v20 and v21, for the added nostalgia value. [\[View the Issue\]](https://github.com/LakeYS/Blockland-Unlimited-Mining-Classic/issues/6)
- [ ] The ability to save an existing mine and re-load it later. [\[View the issue\]](https://github.com/LakeYS/Blockland-Unlimited-Mining-Classic/issues/22)
